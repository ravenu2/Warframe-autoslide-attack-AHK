# Warframe-autoslide-attack-AHK
Hey! I created somewhat of a working AHK for warframe that lets you switch between autoattacking and auto slide attacking.
Numpad numbers for usage, you can change them in the code if you gotta.
Numpad 8 to toggle suspend on the keybinds so you can type e and shit
Numpad 9 to change between autoattacking and auto slide attacking
Hold down E and shit would go down.
You might have to start it in admin mode, not sure.
